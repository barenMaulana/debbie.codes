title: Building Components in Harmony
date: 2021-05-19
description: What if we thought about building components so that they are extendable, theme-able, and reusable across different code bases. If we could do that then we would be able to deliver applications at a much faster pace. We would be able to scale much easier. It's not easy but that is exactly why Bit Harmony was built.
