Everything in life takes time and when you are a dev advocate you try to do so much but there are only so many hours in the day. Some people say to me:

Well one answer I have for you is [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/).

First of all What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot basically gives you suggestions as you type. It can either give you a word, a full sentence or a snippet of code. As the suggestions come up you can either ignore them or press the tab key and it will add the suggestion for you. I am telling you it is a really funny tool when writing blog posts and I have been using it for a while now. Some of the sentences I have written have been suggested to me by GitHub Copilot. Sometimes I take the suggestion and edit it as it is quicker than writing a new sentence.
