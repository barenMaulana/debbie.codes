One of the hardest parts of my job used to be when I was given a design and asked how long it would take to turn it into a working application. The joys of working in agencies when sometimes work comes in at a stage when the design has already been created meaning it has to be created as per design with no input from the engineering team. Unfortunately this is sometimes how agencies work.

So what do you do in this scenario? It is never easy to calculate the time it will take to turn a design into a working application. It is always a challenge to get the right time.
