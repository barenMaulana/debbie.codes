title: It's All About Components
date: 2022-03-31
description: The frontend is a great place to be in these days and as apps get bigger and bigger, components get more difficult to maintain. But are we really building component driven? Do we really know how to take a design and break it down into components? How small do we go? How do we name things? When is it a good time to make a new component or reuse one that is already created? Making these decisions early on is key to great software architecture. If we think before we build, we can build amazing apps that will easily scale.
