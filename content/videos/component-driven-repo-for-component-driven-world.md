title: Component Driven Repo for Component Driven World
date: 2021-10-20
description: We think in monorepos when we want to share components across many teams and apps. but let's face it, we all hate monorepos. As soon as we hear the word we just think legacy. But it doesn't have to be. But if we make our repos component driven, where we can easily share components across any repos or apps then everything changes. We really are moving towards a component driven world so lets start building in component driven repos.
