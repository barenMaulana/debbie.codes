title: Going Static in a Dynamic World with Hasura and Nuxt.js
date: 2020-11-06
description: This talk covers how to use static sites with Hasura, from setting up your endpoint, adding the query to Nuxt.js to display your data with Apollo and GraphQL, how to setup a hook so that it triggers a deploy of your site on content change as static sites need to be redeployed on content change.
